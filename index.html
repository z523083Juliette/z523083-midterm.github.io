                        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!<br></h3>
                        <p>I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you all. I'm Juliette Destang, a computer
                            engineering
                            aficionado with a deep love for video games, skydiving, and cooking. By day, I'm immersed in
                            the world of gaming tech at Ubisoft, and by every other moment, I'm chasing adrenaline
                            rushes and culinary delights.<br> <br>

                            At Ubisoft, I'm fortunate to blend my passion for gaming with my skills in both frontend and
                            backend development. Crafting captivating user experiences and refining game mechanics isn't
                            just a job for me; it's a creative outlet where I get to push the boundaries of what's
                            possible in gaming technology.<br> <br>

                            But life isn't just about work, right? When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me
                            soaring through the sky. Skydiving isn't just a hobby; it's a metaphor for my approach to
                            life — diving headfirst into new challenges, embracing the unknown with courage and
                            excitement.<br> <br>

                            Thanks for letting me share a glimpse of my world with you all.</p>
