                        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!<br></h3>
                        <p>I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you all. I'm Juliette Destang, a computer
                            engineering aficionado with a deep love for video games, skydiving, and cooking. By day, I'm
                            immersed in the world of gaming tech at Ubisoft, and by every other moment, I'm chasing
                            adrenaline rushes and culinary delights.<br> <br> At Ubisoft, I'm fortunate to blend my
                            passion for gaming with my skills in both frontend and backend development. Crafting
                            captivating user experiences and refining game mechanics isn't just a job for me; it's a
                            creative outlet where I get to push the boundaries of what's possible in gaming
                            technology.<br> <br> But life isn't just about work, right? When I'm not knee-deep in
                            code, you'll find me soaring through the sky. Skydiving isn't just a hobby; it's a metaphor
                            for my approach to life — diving headfirst into new challenges, embracing the unknown with
                            courage and excitement.<br> <br> Thanks for letting me share a glimpse of my world with you
                            all.</p>

                        <p>In Bomberman, you control a character who navigates through a maze-like grid.<br><br> The
                            objective is to strategically place bombs to destroy obstacles and enemies while avoiding
                            getting caught in the bomb blasts yourself.<br><br> The goal varies depending on the mode
                            you're playing, but usually involves defeating enemies or reaching a specific destination.
                            Power-ups can enhance your abilities, like increasing bomb range or speed. Be careful though,
                            because one wrong move can lead to blowing yourself up!</p>

                        <p> Gomoku is a strategy board game similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, played on a grid where players try
                            to get five of their pieces in a row.<br><br> The AI analyzes the game board, predicts
                            opponent moves, and selects its own moves to maximize its chances of winning. It typically
                            employs algorithms like minimax, alpha-beta pruning, or neural networks to make strategic
                            decisions.</p>
